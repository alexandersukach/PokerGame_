Not updating the players based on whether they have folded....



Each betting round begins with the buy In amount....I want the balance to carry over....do i need another constructor


Whenever I check first round, the first CPU always bets $50, CPU 4 raises by 73, CPU 3 is not shown, yet pops up in later round
