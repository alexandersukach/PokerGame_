                       Texas Hold'em Poker Rules
                 =====================================
- Start by specifying the buy-in amount at the beginning of the game.
- During each round of betting, players can check, bet, call, or raise, depending on the current game conditions.
- Starting with the small blind and proceeding clockwise, each player
  receives two 'hole cards' which remain concealed from others.
- Players engage in a round of betting based on their hole cards and
  community cards to be revealed.
- A card is then 'burned', or removed from the deck.
- The subsequent three cards are placed face up on the board (the flop).
- Following the flop, another round of betting ensues.
- A card is then 'burned' and the next card is placed face up (the turn).
- Another round of betting follows the turn.
- A final card is then 'burned' and (the river) card is drawn following
  it, which completes the set of community cards.
- The final round of betting takes place, and players try to form their
  best 5-card hand, utilizing both their 'hole cards' and the 'community
  cards' on the table.
- If players have equal hands, a 'chop pot' occurs.
