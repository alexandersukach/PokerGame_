Header File - includes class and member declarations

Ex.) Card::Card(Rank r, Suit s) : rank(r), suit(s) {}
is constructor for Card class, defined using 
    (::) - scope resolution operator
    indicating that it belongs to the Card class.
    It takes Rank and Suit as parameters and initializes
    the private fields with the provided data.


The include guard (the #ifndef, #define, and #endif statements)
 prevents a header file from being included more than once within
  the same source file. Here's how it works:

When a source file includes a header file, the preprocessor checks 
if the #ifndef condition is true. Initially, it's always true because 
the identifier DECK_H is not defined.
The preprocessor defines DECK_H using #define. This means that if the 
same header file is included in other source files, the #ifndef condition
 will be false in those source files because DECK_H is already defined.
As a result, the content of the header file is included in the first 
source file, but in subsequent source files, it's skipped due to the 
#ifndef condition being false.

Edit: Making Header fields

iostrem - standard c++ lib allows for i/o operations...
reading from keyboard/writing from screen

Am I essentially doing :: every instance
    ex. Rank getRank()
        Card::Rank Card::getRank()


So if I make these doubly linekd lists and push the top card of one deck onto 
the bottom of another deck, will that be enoudh....or do i need to dosome sort of loopage
